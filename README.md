# ProductDetails
I have used database first approach, where I am getting the entities via edmx files. 
I have implemented API calls for adding,modifying,deleting and displaying the products.
I have used swagger in order to display the output.
In order to view the output in the localhost , please use the link as 'localhost:portnumber/swagger/'. Example : 'http://localhost:55393/swagger'. 
After clicking on 'list operations', you can see the different set of actions (Listing data, modfying, adding and deleting data). 
Changes are persisting in DB after every action.
